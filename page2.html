            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This GIS project created a detailed visualization of the ethnic distribution in New York City using data from the American Community Survey. The map illustrates the spatial distribution of major ethnic groups—White, Asian, Black, and Others—across the city's boroughs. The main map, complemented by individual ethnic group maps, highlights the areas of concentration and diversity within the city. Notably, the White population is predominant in Staten Island, Manhattan, and parts of Brooklyn and Queens, while the Asian population is primarily concentrated in Queens and southern Brooklyn. The Black/African American population is centralized in the Bronx and deep Brooklyn.
            <br>
            <br>
            This map underscores the city's ethnic diversity and the degree of geographic segregation among ethnic groups. It also reveals significant demographic patterns that are crucial for urban planning, community services, and policy-making. By providing a visual representation of the ethnic landscape of New York City, this study offers valuable insights into the diverse yet segmented nature of the city’s demographic makeup and highlights the need for targeted resources and support for various communities.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This research examines the urban development of Brasilia, Brazil, and its implications for the young residents of illegal settlements. By analyzing vector data provided by the Brazilian government, it was possible to identify the disparities in the distribution of public facilities and transportation infrastructure, which have a significant impact on the lives of young residents. The findings highlight the urgent need for targeted policies to address these inequalities and foster a more equitable urban environment.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">In the face of climate change, extreme weather events have become more and more common across the globe. With these extreme weather events, we have seen areas destroyed. Many people across the United States do not know the risk of being exposed to these extreme weather events. In New Jersey, many homes are at risk of being affected by flooding, particularly in areas across Southern New Jersey. Due to New Jersey’s geographical location and the rampant acceleration of climate change, the state is highly vulnerable to storms, storm surges, and flooding. Many areas across the state are considered high risk regarding flooding. Ocean County is one area in particular with extreme flood zones, as seen in the damage the county experienced during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In the face of climate change and more extreme weather events, are many homes at risk of loss due to flooding throughout Ocean County, New Jersey?

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The interaction between intensive agriculture and climate fluctuations has led to significant changes in nutrient levels and sea temperatures, resulting in the emergence of algal blooms. These blooms pose a threat to marine ecosystems by depleting oxygen levels and rendering habitats inhospitable to various organisms. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been implemented as a strategy to mitigate environmental loss. This study focuses on the effectiveness of MPAs in the Gulf of Mexico in addressing algal blooms and preserving marine biodiversity. The overall question is: To what extent do recent algal bloom patterns in the Gulf of Mexico serve as indicators of the effectiveness of the Marine Protected Area (MPA) in preserving marine ecosystem health and biodiversity? The algal blooms are displayed through count maps and remote sensing maps. Analyzing algal bloom data from 2012 to 2013 and 2023 near Fort Myers, we observe their presence both inside and outside MPAs. Our findings suggest that while algal blooms remain a persistent issue, MPAs could potentially play a role in regulating them in the future.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Localities across the globe must respond to increasing populations with limited resources. The city government of New York City must seek policies to offset the negative effects of gentrification and the speculative housing market. Even though communities of color in Brooklyn have experienced high levels of displacement, many are still at risk of more dislocation. Thus, this project leverages publicly available data to conduct GIS spatial analysis to inform our understanding of the communities that are currently at risk of displacement. This project also seeks to explore whether HPD’s affordable housing developments are matching the areas with the highest need. Applying four variables related to gentrification to construct a Risk of Displacement map. This is then overlayed with the location of HPD’s affordable housing projects, visualizing the city’s ability to match the housing for those communities that are in most need. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Over the past two years, New York City has witnessed a notable influx of immigrants into its Department of Homeless Services (DHS) facilities, amplifying its "Right to Shelter" designation. While the city is crafting long-term housing solutions for this population, many immigrants have become entrenched in the shelter system, shaping their daily lives around it. This paper addresses critical questions concerning these immigrants, including their daily movement patterns while awaiting resolution of legal status, the conditions necessary for their transitional entry into the country, and the impact on their socioeconomic integration. Spatial analysis reveals that shelter facilities tend to cluster in areas already burdened by high poverty levels, potentially exacerbating the cycle of poverty.</p>
