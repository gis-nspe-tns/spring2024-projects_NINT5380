            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The United States have experienced significant wildfire activities from 2020 to 2022, posing serious environmental and public health challenges. These wildfires  only cause immediate damage to ecosystems and property but also significantly affect air quality across vast regions, with PM2.5 being a major concern. This project aims to visualize and analyze the correlation between wildfire occurrences and the subsequent rise in PM2.5 levels, offering insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of air pollution and its impact on public health.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The state of Kerala, India, experienced devastating floods in August 2018 caused by excessive monsoon rainfall. These floods caused widespread damage to infrastructure, displaced millions, and resulted in significant loss of life. Timely and accurate flood mapping is crucial for effective disaster response and mitigation efforts. This project utilized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Sentinel-1 images processed with SNAP software to carry out flood mapping.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">New York City’s neighborhoods are home to a number of cultural heritages that contribute to the city’s special character and promote social cohesion. However, the unrelenting transformation of the city’s built environment threatens the continued use of sites that support the practice of cultural heritages. Though the New York City Landmarks Law offers protection from alteration, new construction, and demolition to landmark-designated sites, the law’s eligibility criteria privileges material integrity and age and often precludes sites that perpetuate cultural heritages. Recent scholarship argues that the law provides protections to New York City residents unequally by race, class, and level of educational attainment. This analysis explores the correlation between destruction, preservation, and race, income, and level of educational attainment by neighborhood in New York City. The analysis finds no statistically significant correlation between demolition or new buildings and any of the demographic indicators considered in this report; a moderate correlation between alteration and all three demographic indicators; and a high correlation between landmarks and historic districts and level of educational attainment.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Lebanon's historical reliance on a functional train service for regional connectivity and urban development was disrupted by the civil war (1975-1990), leading to high car dependency and significant mobility challenges, particularly in urban areas like Greater Beirut. This project utilizes GIS analysis to assess the potential benefits of rehabilitating Lebanon's train stations, focusing on estimating the number of individuals with easy access to these stations and prioritizing the most beneficial train line for rehabilitation. Through a series of steps including data acquisition, station identification, isochrones analysis, and population data integration, I conclude that the Beirut-Riyak route would serve the highest number of residents within a 15-minute drive, making it the recommended priority for rehabilitation. The analysis also indicates that implementing all three branches could provide access to a train station within 15 minutes for approximately 66.73% of the Lebanese population. This GIS analysis can provide insights for organizations such as Train Train Lebanon and policymakers in advocating for sustainable public transportation and addressing mobility challenges in Lebanon.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This GIS project investigates the connection between slaughterhouse locations and forest loss coverage in the Amazon Rainforest, particularly in Pará state, which has the highest state deforestation rates in Brazil (InfoAmazonia, 2022). Spatial analysis was conducted using forest loss data from 2001 to 2023 (Hansen et. al, 2013) and cattle slaughterhouse locations obtained from the Brazilian Agricultural Management Platform. The methodology involved data processing in QGIS, including merging forest loss layers, buffering slaughterhouse locations, and calculating forest loss statistics. The results reveal that cattle slaughterhouses visually align with forest loss patterns, with 17% of Pará's area being deforested in the past 23 years. The years 2016-2020 witnessed the highest forest loss, coinciding with significant political events in the country. Additionally, forest loss within slaughterhouse buffer areas has higher losses compared to the state loss, highlighting the potential environmental impacts of cattle ranching activities.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Since the early 90’s the mining sector has played an important role in the Chilean economy. The exportation of natural resources became a driver of development in the country. Chile is one of the biggest producers and exporters of minerals such as lithium and copper, these metals are used for the production of energy sources such as electric batteries, solar panels, wind farms among others. The areas that surround the  mines are populated by those who work within the mines and their families. Throughout the past two decades, these populations have been affected by the industrial process that happens in the nearby areas. This project showcases the changes in population within the areas that surround the 99 copper mines in Chile.
